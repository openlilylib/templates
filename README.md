Here is the place for examples showing how to structure
your files and content, especially in a bigger project.
Not only score templates can be placed here - i imagine
that music function templates could be added as well,
or engraver templates.

There may be many templates showing how to the same thing -
for example theree are many ways in which the structure
of a SATB choral piece can be written.  Thus, please write
an explanation highlighting the "design goals" of your
particular template.  Why have you written it this way?
What are its strengths, how does it differ feom other ones?
